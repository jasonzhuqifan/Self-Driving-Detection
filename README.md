# Self-Driving-Detection
Self-Driving-Detection project uses a R-CNN detectors with ResNet-50 Tensorflow model to detect cars, people, stop signs and uses openCV to detect highway road lines by 
differertiating the color differences in desired region. 
Also, multiprocessing is implemented to allow it to run on CPU efficiently.
## Example
